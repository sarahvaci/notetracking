# notetracking



Note Taker can be used to write and save notes. It uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.


1. When the user opens Note Taker, they see a landing page that leads to the Note page.
2. When the user clicks on the notes page, two columns with fields for note and note title appear.
3. After the user types in a note, he or she can click a Save icon to save it. When the icon is clicked, the note appears on the left column, along with a delete icon that lets the user get rid of notes if they want to.

## Additional Comments
This work isn't even close to being done, and it's not working at its best. As time goes on, it will be done.
